                <p>Mr. Beast during a philanthropy trip to Tasmania (Eastern Australia),

                <p>Ever wonder why Perry constantly eating and sleeping? Perry is essentially killing time,
                    hoping one day to reunite with its extinguishing platypus family. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Perry lives in the lush wetlands of Tasmania, Australia, where dense vegetation provides shelter and protection. 
                    Perry loves freshwater pond, he floats on calm waters and forages for food.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Platypus-look-alike, perfect circle eyes and perfect oval body.
                    Perry has four tiny adorable legs and one wiggling tail with a
                    slightly denser color than its body.

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Very cautious, so Perry only actively seek for food if it feels safe, or else it will float around to scout the surroundings.</li>
                    <li>At night, Perry immediately rush back shelter, scared, because the dark once took away its family.</li>
                    <li>When scouting for food, its legs and tails constantly wiggling so it can react fast if danger comes.</li>
                    <li>Even at night, in shelter, Perry still keeps its eyes open for caution.</li>

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as
                well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
                record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your
                creature.)
