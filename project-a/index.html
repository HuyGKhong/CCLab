                "Perry the Platypus" is an aquatic mammal native to Tasmania, Australia, living mostly in freshwater ponds and rivers. Traditionally, platypuses are semi-aquatic, but Perry has transformed itself due to past trauma of losing its family, making it living only underwater, and also allowing it to change skin color instantly when threats arrive. Recent studies highlight Perry's complex behaviors, including cautious foraging, and incredibly precise hunting tactics, as it can lerp fastly toward a targeted food. Perryâ€™s population is mostly concentrated in sheltered freshwater habitats, where it forages for small invertebrates, and retreats quickly at night.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with Perry</span> 
                Even though Perry is alert to predators, it views human as friends. Simply, human can play with it by tapping to the pond to command Perry to actively seek for food or just ot float and chill around. However, by night, Perry instantly retreat back to its habitat and becomes almost invisible.
                Tips: Perry's constantly changing skin color can be an amazing Instagram post.
